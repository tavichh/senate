#SENATE DISCORD BOT
![](Images\plot_join.png)

Senate allows discord servers to hold somewhat of a democracy in their discord. Caesar is a role that's just merely a title but they can proclaim a dictatorship which allows them to be granted more privileges in the discord. However, senators who are not fond of the current Caesar can plot to assassinate him/her and overthrow the current "leader" of the discord.

If a plot has garnered enough people then a vote can be casted to move forward with the plot. If there are more than 1/3rd saying Nay then the vote will not go through and the plot will end. If they are successful, then the person who started the plot ends up being the Caesar.
